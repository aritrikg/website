const INTRO = `Hi, I'm Aritrik Ghosh, an Freelance software developer and technical content writer. I am 
  currently pursuing Master of Technology in Computer science and Engineering and I am
  passionate about building innovative software solutions that solves problems.`;

const WHYSITE = `I’ve always enjoyed building things that feel a little different. Instead of making a typical portfolio, 
I wanted something that brings back the spark that pushed me into tech in the first place.  
My journey started in my school days when I would sit for hours experimenting with small tools and scripts just to see what I could make. That curiosity eventually grew into a career in software development.  
Today, after more than two years of working as an SDE and technical writer, I still try to hold onto that sense of play. 
Recreating a Windows-style interface felt like the perfect way to connect where I started with what I’ve learned. 
This site is meant to feel like you’re opening my personal workspace and exploring my world directly.`;

const INTERESTS = `Outside my regular work of building software and writing technical content, 
I like taking long solo trips. Traveling gives me time to reset, think clearly, and talk to people from places I’ve never been.  
I enjoy learning how different communities live and work, and 
I’ve found that stepping into unfamiliar environments teaches me more than any book or course ever could. 
It helps me stay adaptable, independent, and open to new ideas—qualities that matter in tech just as much as in life.`;

const INTERESTS2 = `Other than traveling, I love trekking and cycling, and as a challenge to myself, I decided 
to embark on a journey to the Everest Base Camp. After a 130KM, 2504M grueling vertical ascend from 
Tenzing-Hillary Airport, widely regarded as some of the world’s most dangerous airports, I made it 
with a friend of mine and our guide. The entire experience was spectacular as I have also met and struck up 
conversations with trekkers from all walks of life and background, and we all had a common goal 
of reaching the top of the base camp.`;

const INTERESTS3 = `Another passion of mine is drone photography. There’s something special about capturing a scene from above—the perspective feels almost unreal.  
Aerial shots open up angles that regular cameras can’t reach, and it’s the closest I’ve come to the feeling of flight. I’ve shared some of my favorite clips on this site.  
I also enjoy reading non-fiction, especially books on technology, entrepreneurship, and personal growth. They feed my curiosity and help me understand the ideas and people shaping the world we work in.`
